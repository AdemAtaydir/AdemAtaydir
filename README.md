###  About me

- I'm Adem Ataydir. I recently completed a comprehensive one-year training course in cyber security, gaining skills in Firewall, EDR, SIEM, and Penetration testing. Afterwards, I completed a two-month internship in which I was able to apply and deepen my theoretical knowledge in practice.

- I enjoy researching cybersecurity systems, learning new information, and continuously working on improving myself.
- My goal is to keep developing until I become one of the best in this field.
